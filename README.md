# KST - Kanji Study Tool

Kanji Study Tool is a web application for those studying the Japanese kanji writing system. It serves as a useful accompaniment to the popular course *Remembering the Kanji* (RTK) by Jamese Heisig. 

The app allows users to make use of the keywords Heisig associates with each kanji to lookup the stroke diagrams, the various readings and English meanings of each character covered in RTK. Additionally, users are able save personal annotations with each kanji character useful when practicing the use of mnemonics advocated by Heisig.
